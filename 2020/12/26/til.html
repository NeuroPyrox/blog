    <ul>
      <li>
        Certificate Transparency (CT) solves the problem of Certificate
        Authorities (CAs) being compromised or going rogue
      </li>
      <li>
        CT makes it difficult for a CA to issue an SSL certificate without the
        domain owner knowing
      </li>
      <li>
        You can subscribe to or create a CT monitor, which watches the logs for
        suspicious certificates
      </li>
      <li>CT uses append-only Merkle Trees just like blockchain</li>
      <li>
        Every certificate log on CT must include its url, public key, and
        timestamp
      </li>
      <li>
        Host-only cookies prevent subdomain.domain.com from reading the cookies
        of domain.com
      </li>
      <li>Host-only is the default</li>
      <li>
        If the domain attribute is used on a cookie, host-only will be false
      </li>
      <li>
        If bar.example.com sets a cookie with domain-attribute "example.com", it
        can be overwritten by foo.example.com, potentially creating security
        vulnerabilities
      </li>
      <li>
        The canonicalized request host must domain-match the domain-attribute
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8.3"
          >Servers should encrypt and sign the contents of cookies, but this
          doesn't prevent an attacker from injecting a cookie from a different
          session or replaying cookies</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8.6"
          >An attacker might be able to force the user agent to delete cookies
          by storing a large number of cookies</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>Cookies rely on DNS for security</li>
      <li>Parent domains can only access the cookies of subdomains via the domain attribute</li>
      <li>Subdomains are vulnerable through csrf through siblings</li>
    </ul>
    Still don't fully understand:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Cookie prefixes and "path=/" are additional ways to secure cookies
      </li>
      <li>Custom headers have a same-origin policy</li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://github.com/pillarjs/understanding-csrf#the-salt-doesnt-have-to-be-cryptographically-secure"
          >CSRF token salt</a
        >
