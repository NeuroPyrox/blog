      New Series: Today I Learned

    <p>
      I'm going to start blogging about new programming concepts that I learn.
      The reason is that I need to feel more productive when I read hours upon
      hours of programming articles without writing any code. For instance,
      today I've been learning about CORS and CSRF, but I feel an uneasiness
      when I look at my GitHub page and don't see it resulting in any commits. I
      realized that to feel more motivated, I need to be able to commit
      something right after I learn something new. That's kind of difficult for
      me because I want to understand every single little thing about a problem
      before I write a single line of code, especially web security which I'm
      learning right now. So I came up with a workaround which will make me feel
      less guilty about my lack of GitHub activity while learning web security:
      <br /><br />
      I will blog about the things that I learn, and commit these posts to
      GitHub.
      <br /><br />
      This way, I can feel like I'm making progress immediately instead of
      waiting until the occasional day when I dump 1000 lines of code out of my
      head. Since I'll see my progress immediately, it will motivate me to learn
      even more. Also, it will help with my writing skills and possibly impress
      future employers, but those are secondary goals.
      <br /><br />
      Anyways, here's a list of today's findings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        SameSite=Lax allows cookies with GET and HEAD, but not POST, PATCH, PUT,
        or DELETE
      </li>
      <li>Old browsers don't support SameSite cookies</li>
      <li>Don't use the wrong HTTP verb for state-changing operations. It's more than a petty semantics issues; it's a security vulnerability.</li>
      <li>Try to use PATCH, PUT, and DELETE instead of POST because POST is vulnerable to CSRF through forms</li>
      <li>Don't use method-override headers because it renders the above security measure useless</li>
      <li>Never create any kind of "/csrf" route where you can access the token. Idk why you'd ever do this, but apparently some people do.</li>
      <li>APIs that use the request body instead of url parameters are secure against CSRF forms</li>
      <li>It's useful to salt your CSRF tokens. Idk how this works, so I'll have to come back to it later</li>
      <li>There are ways to make stateless CSRF tokens, which I also don't understand yet</li>
    </ul>
