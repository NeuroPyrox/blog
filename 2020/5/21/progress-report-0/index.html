    <p>
      After a lot of thinking over the past week, I've concluded that I
      understand neither interaction nets nor agent-based programming well
      enough to use them in my AI project. I need to understand them in order to
      make a DSL where processes require some computational currency as input.
      I'm encountering a chicken and egg type of problem with making such a DSL:
      how do you distribute the computational currency to initialize processes
      if you need a distributor process to already be running? Obviously this
      isn't the right question to ask, but I haven't been able to come up with
      any better questions all week. If I understood interaction nets and
      agent-based programming better, I probably would be able to ask the right
      question.
      <br /><br />
      So how do I go about building my understanding? I already understand the
      theoretical parts of it. The part I'm failing at is implementation. In
      fact, I have zero idea how I would go about writing any sufficiently
      complicated program with interaction nets or agents. What I ought to do
      then is to practice writing programs with them so that I can build
      intuition that will carry over to my AI.
      <br /><br />
      I've already worked a bit toward making a visual interface for interaction
      nets <a href="/2020/5/20/interaction-sprites">here</a> and ASTs
      <a href="/2020/5/17/pills">here</a>. They're quite basic so far, but
      that's only because I haven't gotten into the flow yet. A few weeks of
      consistent daily progress and I'll be pumping out code in no time. My plan
      is to make a visual programming language with interaction nets that
      completely replaces JavaScript in my workflow, then I can explore ways of
      making functional representations of it and of adding a computational
      currency. Ideally, I want a functional representation that's isomorphic to
      every deadlock-free interaction net. <br /><br />
      I'm really excited to be writing actual code again instead of just
      thinking all day because this will also build my developer portfolio for
      getting a programming job. I kind of hope I remain stumped so that I have
      more reasons to practice coding and people stop viewing me as unproductive
      for staring off into space all day.
