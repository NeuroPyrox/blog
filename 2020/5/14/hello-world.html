      Once upon a time you had a dream and I had a dream. In my dream I caught a
      fleeting glimpse of digital organisms which self-organized into societies.
      My dream drove me to madness, betting everything on my ability to invent
      artificial general intelligence. Now, tell me your dream and how it
      intertwined with mine.
