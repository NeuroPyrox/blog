      TLDR: I SOLVED AGI!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
      I finally understand interaction nets. Instead of writing code using them
      like I planned on, I got some sudden insights that allowed me to figure
      everything out on paper. In fact, I've completely solved AGI now. I know
      that sounds crazy, but I'll make it clear by coding up some
      demonstrations. Also, I've decided to name my AGI Calcifer after the
      character from Howl's Moving Castle.
