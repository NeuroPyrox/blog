    <ul>
      <li>
        In OPRF, the client blinds the input and unblinds the output via inverse
        group elements
      </li>
      <li>
        In OPRF, the server combines its secret with the client's blinded input
        within a cryptographic group
      </li>
      <li>
        Clients can send (t, HMAC(OPRF(t), message) to the server as a one-time
        signed token for CAPTCHAS
      </li>
      <li>
        In OPAQUE, the client uses the OPRF result as a key to store an
        encrypted envelope on the server
      </li>
      <li>
        In OPAQUE, the envelope contains keys that will be used in an
        Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE)
      </li>
      <li>
        In OPAQUE registration, the client stores a random public/private key
        pair, as well as the server's public key in the envelope
      </li>
      <li>
        In OPAQUE registration, the server sends its public key in the same
        response as the OPRF
      </li>
      <li>
        In OPAQUE, the server stores the client's plaintext public key, their
        envelope, and the unique OPRF key for that user
      </li>
    </ul>
    Still don't fully understand:
    <ul>
      <li>
        In OPAQUE, what the client should do after retrieving the envelope's
        contents
      </li>
    </ul>
