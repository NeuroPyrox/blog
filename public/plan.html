    <p>
      Its been a while since I posted here.
      I've been working on my AI all Summer, but recently I hit a roadblock.
      I need an API for my AI to submit generated music to and recieve scores on each song.
      However, the AudioWorklets API is an absolute headache to work with, so I've decided to put my AI on the backburner again.
      <br>
      Here's my new plan:
      I want to get a team of people together that can help me write the glue code for my AI.
      To build my team, I want to start a web development firm which has a heavy focus on developing more productive tools.
      By tools I mean libraries, code editors, REPLs, languages, etc.
      The reason for the focus on productive tooling is twofold.
      First, I want to test out a way of incentivizing it called quadratic funding (discussed next paragraph).
      Second, the tools would benefit my AI project by cutting down the glue code I need to write.
      I want other people to help my write all the tooling because I looked at all the tools I want to write, and the task is simply monumental.
      Here's a list of the tools I want:
      <ol>
        <li>A clean concurrency model in the browser that abstracts away WebWorker details</li>
        <li>A fullstack Lisp environment for the web that you can add incrementally to a project</li>
        <li>Being able to compile macro-expanded functions to WASM at runtime</li>
        <li>Plug-n-play composable web components</li>
        <li>A quadratic funding website</li>
      </ol>
      So why do I want to test out quadratic funding?
      Because it seems like a scalable way for me to manage a team, especially since I'm not a social person.
      With quadratic funding, people wouldn't have to get my permission to take initiative on a new project.
      They'd just ask their coworkers to vote toward funding the project.
      What?! Coworkers voting to fund each others' projects? Sounds like a recipe for disaster, right?
      Well, quadratic funding has certain incentive structures that make collusion very difficult.
      I believe my knowledge of quadratic funding would be a competitive advantage that others couldn't replicate.
      <br>
      Why do I want my team to function autonomously without my guidance?
      Wouldn't that just be giving up me leadership role?
      Well, I don't want people constantly harassing  me to fund their projects.
      If I automated the funding process, I'd be at ease.
      Besides, I don't particularly care who's the leader as long as good decisions get made.
