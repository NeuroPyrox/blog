      Didn't solve AGI

    <p>
      I didn't solve AGI. <br />
      18 days and 31 pages of notes later, and the tiny loose ends grew to be
      enormous challenges. Specifically, I can't figure out how to let agents
      send lambdas to each other without parasitism taking place. My gut tells
      me I need an eval function to solve it, but my head is spinning because
      it's such an abstract problem.<br />
      I need to practice coding special cases to make any progress.
