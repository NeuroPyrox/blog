    <p>
      I need to get clients for web design.
      For that I need a website where they can schedule stuff.
      This website needs to have my portfolio on it.
      It also needs a calendar with bidding.
      They'll pay ahead of time and get a refund if they want for 90 days.
      Okay, the first thing I need to do then is make a calendar.
