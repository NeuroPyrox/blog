    <ul>
      <li>
        If you don't protect login forms against CSRF, then an attacker can
        switch your session to a different account and steal sensitive
        information that you submit
      </li>
      <li>
        The synchronizer token pattern is more secure than double submit cookies
        because cookies can be overwritten by subdomains, allowing CSRF
      </li>
      <li>
        Server-side state for non-authenticated sessions makes you more
        vulnerable to DOS attacks
      </li>
      <li>Helmet is a small JavaScript library for setting http headers</li>
      <li>
        The X-Frame-Options header can protect against clickjacking by
        preventing your site from being contained in a frame
      </li>
      <li>The SameSite header can prevent Iframes from accessing cookies</li>
      <li>
        If you store session IDs in URLs, then an attacker can inject their own
        session ID through a malicious link
      </li>
      <li>
        Authentication and tamper detection are the 2 ways to detect MITM
        attacks
      </li>
      <li>
        TLS provides a way to authenticate public keys via a trusted 3rd party,
        somewhat preventing MITM attacks
      </li>
      <li>
        Latency examination can uncover MITM in some situations, especially with
        long calculations that take several seconds like hash functions
      </li>
      <li>Punycode is a unicode representation only using ascii characters</li>
      <li>
        Punycode can be used to prevent url spoofing by protecting against
        similar-looking unicode characters
      </li>
      <li>
        SSL stripping is a MITM attack which downgrades a connection into an
        unencrypted one
      </li>
      <li>
        Not practical, but quantum computing can theoretically mitigate MITM
        through the no-cloning theorem
      </li>
      <li>A MITM can write cookies via HTTP redirects</li>
      <li>HSTS can be used to prevent a MITM from writing cookies</li>
    </ul>
    Still don't fully understand:
    <ul>
      <li>Subdomain attacks</li>
      <li>IP and DNS spoofing</li>
      <li>Certificate Transparency</li>
    </ul>
